### ðŸš© Why This Track?

1. **Windows is the most targeted OS for malware and reverse engineering** â€” mastering it puts you in a high-ground position.
2. **System-level access** (registry, memory, processes) is the foundation of malware behavior.
3. **Reverse engineering Windows binaries** (PE format) requires knowing how theyâ€™re built and behave.

### ðŸ›  Tools Youâ€™ll Touch

* `MinGW`, `windbg`, `x64dbg`
* `PE-bear`, `Ghidra`, `IDA Free`
* `CFF Explorer`, `ProcMon`, `RegEdit`

### ðŸ“š Supporting Resources

* **Windows API programming** tutorials (start with MSDN + [Forgerâ€™s WinAPI Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226162330/http://www.winprog.org/tutorial/))
* **Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering**
* **Windows Internals** (Pavel Yosifovich)

### âœ… Why Not GUI, Sockets, or Cross-Platform?

* GUI programming is useful **later** if you want to make malware that mimics legit programs â€” but not core now.
* Sockets (Winsock) are **important**, but youâ€™ll get there after mastering processes, memory, and reverse engineering.
* Cross-platform is great long-term, but now itâ€™s better to **deep dive into Windows-specific internals**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Recommendation:

**Start with Windows System Programming** â†’ then gradually **move into binary analysis and reverse engineering**.

Letâ€™s kick it off with **Project 1: Simple Process Spawner**
