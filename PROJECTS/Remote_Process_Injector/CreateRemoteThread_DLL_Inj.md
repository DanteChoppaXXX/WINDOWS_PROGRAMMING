## üß† **What to Do Next:** Deep Process Manipulation

We'll start with **Process Injection Techniques**, the bread and butter of offensive tooling, malware analysis, and EDR evasion understanding.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what we‚Äôll cover step-by-step:

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 1: **CreateRemoteThread Injection**

> **Goal:** Inject a DLL or shellcode into another process using:

* `OpenProcess`
* `VirtualAllocEx`
* `WriteProcessMemory`
* `CreateRemoteThread`

#### üß† Logic Walkthrough (No Code Yet):

1. **Target Process Selection**:

   * Use a known PID (like Notepad).
   * Later we‚Äôll automate process listing.

2. **Open Target Process**:

   * Use `OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS)` to get a handle.

3. **Allocate Memory in Target**:

   * `VirtualAllocEx` allocates memory **inside the target process**.

4. **Write Payload**:

   * Use `WriteProcessMemory` to copy data (DLL path or shellcode) into that memory.

5. **Execute Remotely**:

   * `CreateRemoteThread` starts a new thread **in the target**.
   * Entry point: `LoadLibraryA` (for DLL injection) or pointer to your shellcode.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prep Before We Inject:

To get ready, we‚Äôll first write 2 mini tools:

#### 1. **MiniTool: Launch Notepad + Get PID**

* Launch `notepad.exe` using `CreateProcess`.
* Print the PID.

#### 2. **MiniTool: Write ‚Äúhello.dll‚Äù and inject it into Notepad**

* We‚Äôll start by injecting a simple DLL that shows a message box.

### After This?

We‚Äôll then move on to:

* DLL injection via `SetWindowsHookEx`
* Manual shellcode injection
* Self-injection (current process)
* Obfuscating injections
