# ⚙️ **WINDOWS C PROGRAMMING PATH**

*A practical project-based roadmap for Windows fluency*

We’ll go stage-by-stage like we’ve been doing. Every stage will build your intuition, muscle memory, and practical skill with the Windows API.

---

### 🔰 STAGE 1: Process Creation, Control, and I/O

> Goal: Master process and file I/O with WinAPI

#### ✅ Projects:

1. **Mini File Writer/Reader**

   * Open file, write some data, close.
   * Re-open, read and print to console.

2. **Process Spawner with Arguments**

   * Use `CreateProcess()` to run a program with custom arguments (e.g., open Notepad with a file).

3. **Mini Console Logger**

   * Redirect output to a file.
   * Log timestamps + messages with `SYSTEMTIME`.

---

### 🧠 You’ll Learn:

* File descriptors, `HANDLE`
* `CreateFile`, `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`
* `CreateProcess`, `STARTUPINFO`, `PROCESS_INFORMATION`
* Environment blocks, working directories
* Struct initialization and memory zeroing

---

### 🛡️ STAGE 2: Process and Memory Exploration

> Goal: Get comfortable accessing and scanning external process memory

#### ✅ Projects:

1. **Process Enumerator**

   * List all running processes with ToolHelp32.

2. **Memory Reader**

   * Select a process (by name or PID), and dump a memory region.

3. **Simple Pattern Scanner**

   * Search for a byte pattern in remote process memory.

---

### 🧠 You’ll Learn:

* `OpenProcess`, `ReadProcessMemory`
* `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`, `PROCESSENTRY32`, `MODULEENTRY32`
* Filtering by name
* `MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION`, `VirtualQueryEx`

---

### 🔌 STAGE 3: DLLs and Remote Threads

> Goal: Understand DLL mechanics and basic injection

#### ✅ Projects:

1. **Write a DLL with a visible effect**

   * A DLL that shows a MessageBox on `DllMain`.

2. **Manual DLL Injector (Classic LoadLibrary Style)**

   * Use `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `CreateRemoteThread`.

3. **Process-aware Injector**

   * Check if process is running first.
   * If not, start it, then inject.

---

### 🧠 You’ll Learn:

* `LoadLibraryA`, `GetProcAddress`
* `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`
* `CreateRemoteThread`
* DLL compilation and export

---

### 🧨 STAGE 4: PE Structure Awareness

> Goal: Learn to walk and understand the Portable Executable (PE) structure in memory

#### ✅ Projects:

1. **Mini PE Dumper**

   * Load a PE file and print: DOS header, NT headers, section names.

2. **Manual Mapper Lite**

   * Allocate memory, copy headers + sections (you already did this — now reinforce it).

---

### 🧠 You’ll Learn:

* PE header parsing
* Structures like `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER`, `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS`
* `VirtualAlloc`, memory copying
* Alignment, section headers, image base

---

### 🚀 STAGE 5: Final Transition to Manual Mapping & Reflective Loaders

> Goal: Revisit the project you paused, now with mastery and intuition

At this point, we return to:

* Manually mapping DLLs
* Resolving imports manually
* Fixing relocations
* Creating reflective shellcode
