Hereâ€™s a **step-by-step algorithm** to write a **Process Enumerator program in C for Windows**. This program will list all currently running processes, along with details like their process IDs and optionally the executable name.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Overview**

We'll use the **Windows API**, particularly:

* `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`
* `Process32First`
* `Process32Next`
* The `PROCESSENTRY32` structure

These APIs are part of `<tlhelp32.h>` and require linking against `Kernel32.lib`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm: Process Enumerator (Windows C)

---

### **STEP 1: Include Required Headers**

* Include Windows headers necessary for process enumeration.

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <tlhelp32.h>
#include <tchar.h>
#include <stdio.h>
```

---

### **STEP 2: Define the Entry Point**

* Create a `main()` function as the entry point of the program.

---

### **STEP 3: Take a Snapshot of All Processes**

1. Use `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` with the `TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS` flag.
2. Store the handle it returns (type: `HANDLE`).
3. Check if the handle is `INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE`. If so, print an error and exit.

---

### **STEP 4: Initialize a `PROCESSENTRY32` Structure**

1. Create a variable of type `PROCESSENTRY32` and zero it out.
2. Set its `dwSize` field to `sizeof(PROCESSENTRY32)` before using it in API calls.

---

### **STEP 5: Retrieve the First Process**

1. Use `Process32First` to get the first process in the snapshot.
2. If it fails, print an error and close the handle.

---

### **STEP 6: Iterate Over Remaining Processes**

1. Use a loop (`do...while`) to iterate using `Process32Next`.
2. For each process:

   * Extract the process ID: `pe32.th32ProcessID`
   * Extract the executable file name: `pe32.szExeFile`
   * Print or log the information

---

### **STEP 7: Clean Up**

* After you're done enumerating, close the snapshot handle using `CloseHandle`.

---

### **STEP 8: Exit the Program**

* Return from `main()` with an appropriate exit code.

## âœ… Optional Enhancements

To make the program more advanced:

| Feature               | Idea                                                      |                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Get parent PID        | Use `pe32.th32ParentProcessID`                            |                           |
| Display memory usage  | Combine with `OpenProcess()` and `GetProcessMemoryInfo()` |                           |
| Access process handle | Use \`OpenProcess(PROCESS\_QUERY\_INFORMATION             | PROCESS\_VM\_READ, ...)\` |
| Sort or filter        | Sort processes alphabetically or filter by name substring |                           |

---

## ðŸ§ª Basic Test Plan

* Run the program and check that all system and user processes are listed.
* Validate by comparing with Task Manager or `tasklist` in CMD.
* Test with elevated and non-elevated privileges.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Note

Make sure to **compile with a Windows C compiler** like MSVC or MinGW, and **link against `Kernel32.lib`** (usually done automatically).

Would you like me to walk you through enhancements like **listing modules/DLLs per process**, **memory usage**, or **dumping command lines**?
